    "- The stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) storage area in memory used for temporary storage.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- The stack pointer register points to the position where the next item will be stored.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- The stack has a top and a bottom. The bottom is the highest memory address and the top is the lowest memory address. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- The stack must be on page one and usually starts at address \\\\$01FF and builds towards address \\\\$0100 as items are added to it.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- Since the stack is limited to page one it cannot store more than 256 bytes which is reserved in memory even when it isn't in use.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- JSR instruction uses stack too. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- Most systems automatically start stack pointer to \\\\$01FF but if it isn't it can be done using TXS (Transfer X to Stack pointer):-\n",
