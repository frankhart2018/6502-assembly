    "# Review of the flags\n",
    "\n",
    "- Seven of the eight bits are used as status flags. The seven status flags are:- sign, overflow, break, decimal mode, interrupt disable, zero, and carry.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- For conditional instructions sign, zero, and carry flags are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Zero flag\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is set (equal to 1) when a value becomes zero, otherwise it is turned off or cleared (equa to 0).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- It is set or cleared as the result of any command that changes the value in a register or that increments or decrements a memory location or as a result of certain other commands like compare.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- The zero or other flags aren't affected by branching and jumping instructions or moving data to memory.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- A zero result turns the zero flag on and a non-zero result turns it off.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Carry flag\n",
    "\n",
    "- The carry flag indicates whether an operation caused an overflow, i.e. whether the result is too large for the receiving byte.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- It is set after addition operation if a one is carried from MSB and may be lost.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- It is also set if a subtraction operation did not need to borrow in order to subtract the MSB.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- Otherwise it is cleared by any arithmetic operation except increment or decrement.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- It is also turned off or on by the CLC and SEC commands.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- The carry flag tells whether the result of an arithmetic operation has overflowed the accumulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sign flag\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sign flag reflects the value of the MSB in the result field. If MSB is on the sign flag is set, if it is OFF then the sign flag is cleared.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- This is because most programmers like to reserve MSB as a sign bit, limiting the value in a byte to seven bits.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- IF sign bit is on, the value is negative, if it is off the value is positive.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- The sign flag duplicates information and can be tested by the conditional instructions.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- The sign flag is affected by any command that changes the value in a register or that increments or decrements a memory location."
