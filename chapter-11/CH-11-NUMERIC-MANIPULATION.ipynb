    "# Multibyte Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multibyte arithmetic is done on values stored in memory. Each byte is moved into the accumulator as it is needed.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- In multibyte arithmetic, we usually don't work with values that have been converted to pure binary form. We instead work with a data representation system called binary coded decimal (BCD). This is also referred to as packed decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bcd-hex.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- We see that in the hex value of equivalent BCD is equal to the decimal value.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- In BCD a byte is split into halves (called nibbles) and both nibbles represent a number between 0 to 9. Values A to F are forbidden. E.g:- 83 when converted to BCD has 8 in the upper nibble and 3 in the lower one.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- To prevent the resulting BCD from being invalid, we use an instruction called SED (SEt Decimal mode). This has no operands, and instructs the processor to use BCD arithmetic until further notice.\n",
