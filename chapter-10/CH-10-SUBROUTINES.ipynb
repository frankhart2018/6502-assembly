    "- This program reads and adds two digits between 0 and 4. It validates each input byte and writes an error message if a byte is invalid. It works as follows:-\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The GETN1 routine reads and validates the first input digit. It loops until a valid digit is obtained. SAVEN1 is a part of GETN1.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The GETN2 routine reads and validates the second input digit. It also loops until a valid digit is obtained.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The ADDIT routine adds the two digits and writes the answer. Control is returned to GETN1 to start the next problem.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The NEWLIN routine starts a new line on the terminal.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The CHECK routine validates the byte in A. If the input byte is between '0' and '4', the X register is set to 0. If not, it is set to \\\\$FF. NOGOD is part of the check routine.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The ERROR routine puts out a message if the input doesn't validate. ERLOOP is part of the routine.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The INPUT routine reads one byte from the keyboard and places it in the accumulator. TESTIN is part of this routine.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The OUTPUT routine prints one byte from the accumulator to the terminal.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- Most assembly language programs contain three major parts:-\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The main line is the code that's logically between the start (the first executed instruction) and the stop (however that happens). If the main line contains more than one routine (as indicated by labelled statements), the routine receives control by fall-through or branches.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The subroutines are sections of code that are not in the main line. They recieve control only by JSR commands. They are positioned and coded so that they never receive control by fall-through, jumps, or branches.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The data area definitions reserve memory bytes to hold data. They are positioned so that they will never receive control.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- In the above program lines 6-33 comprise of main line, 34-72 contain subroutines, and 73-75 comprise of data area definitions.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- A subroutine is thus a routine that receives control only by the JSR instruction. It mostly performs one function and releases control by a return which returns control to the instruction following JSR.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- Using JSR to transfer control to subroutine is called calling the subroutine. In other assembly languages this command to transfer control is CALL. This works in two steps:-\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The address in the PC register is pushed back into the stack. At the time it is pushed it is pointing at the third byte of the JSR instruction.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The address in the JSR instruction operand is loaded into the PC. Thus, that address becomes the next instruction.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- Return works as follows:-\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    - The top of the stack is pulled into the PC. This should be the address that was pushed by the JSR instruction."
